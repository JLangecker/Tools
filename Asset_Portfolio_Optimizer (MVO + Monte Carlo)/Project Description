This project was written in python to take a set of asset returns as parameters and create mean variance optimized portfolios based on them. 
It outputs a csv that can then be used to run a monte carlo simulation to test the created portfolios and compare their performance.

It contains the following (uncompiled) files:
- MVO.py ... A python script that takes in a .csv of asset returns, performs mean variance optimization and outputs a .csv containing the optimized portfolios
- Monte_Carlo.py ... A python script that takes the created portfolios from the .csv and simultes market conditions for a given timeframe to check their performance.

It also contains the following auxiliary file:
- Data_Generator.xlsx ... which I used to generate normally distributed asset returns data to test the scripts

The MVO.py file currently draws from "Asset_Returns_Data.csv" and outputs to "Example_Portfolios.csv", from which the Monte_Carlo.py file draws. As both scripts are 
currently uncompiled, I used them from VSCode with the relevant libraries installed. They also both output key information to the terminal.

For more detailed descriptions of how the scripts work, please refer to the comments in the scripts themselves.

This is my first proper project, so I apologize in advance for ugly code formatting and any violations of coding etiquette that may have occurred.
